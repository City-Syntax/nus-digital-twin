NUS Digital Twin offers a public API for its data, found at [nus-digital-twin.com/api/v1](/api/v1).

Looking to learn how to use the API? Go to the [API Reference](/api-reference).

## Common Issues

### The API returns a plain text response instead of JSON

Ensure that the endpoint file in `src/pages/api/v1/*.ts` is excluded from pre-rendering.

```diff lang=ts
// src/pages/api/v1/example.ts
+export const prerender = false;
...
```
