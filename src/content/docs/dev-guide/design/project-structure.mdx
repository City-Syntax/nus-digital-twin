import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This article provides an overview of the NUS Digital Twin code base.

## General Structure

<FileTree>

- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- README.md
- tsconfig.json
- .husky/
- public/
- src
  - assets/
  - components/
  - content/
  - layouts/
  - pages/
  - styles/
  - content.config.ts
  - store.ts
  - types.ts

</FileTree>

## The Astro config File

The Astro config file at the root of the repository contains the configuration for the whole Astro project.

<FileTree>

- **astro.config.mjs**
- public/
- src/
- ...

</FileTree>

Read Astro's [configuration reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/) for a full overview of all supported configuration options.

## The `public/` directory

The `public/` directory contains assets that are directly added to the application without being processed by Astro.

<FileTree>

- ...
- **public/**
- src/
- ...

</FileTree>

The `public/` directory includes the following files:

- 3D Models files, such as `.glTF`, `.dae`, and `.3dm` files
- GIS Shapefiles and its accompanying files
- EnergyPlus `.idf` files
- Tutorial videos
- Other downloadable assets, such as `.zip` files

The `public/` directory is organised such that assets for each building is stored in its respective sub-directories. The sub-directories are as follows:

<FileTree>

- public
  - \<building-name\> For building-level models and EnergyPlus
    - \<building-name\>.idf
    - \<building-name\>.glTF
    - \<building-name\>.3dm
  - shapefiles For GIS shapefiles
    - \<shapefile-type\>
      - \<name\>.shp
      - \<name\>.zip
      - ...
  - tutorials For tutorial videos
    - \<name\>.mp4
    - ...
  - urban For Urban Scale Rhino model
    - rhino-urban.glTF
    - data/ Cesium 3DTiles

</FileTree>

## The `src/` directory

The `src/` directory contains the main source code that powers NUS Digital Twin.

<FileTree>

- ...
- public/
- **src/**
- ...

</FileTree>

### The `assets/` directory

The `assets/` directory contain assets that are processed by Astro, such as images.

<FileTree>

- src
  - **assets/**
  - components/
  - ...

</FileTree>

The `assets/` directory is organised such that assets for each building is stored in its respective sub-directories. Global assets are stored within the `assets/` directory.

<FileTree>

- src/assets
  - \<building-name\> For building images
    - image.png
    - image.jpg
    - ...
  - global-asset.png For global images
  - ...

</FileTree>

Refer to Astro's [image documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images) for more details.
