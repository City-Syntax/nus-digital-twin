This article guides you on how to write documentation for NUS Digital Twin.

NUS Digital Twin provides the following 3 sets of documentations for users and developers:

- [User Guide](/user-guide)
- [Developer Guide](/dev-guide)
- [API Reference](/api-reference)

The documentation site is powered by [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build), and supports all the features offered by Starlight.

## Documentation Structure

The files for the documentation is stored in the directory `src/content/docs`.

The documentation is mostly written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), though Markdown files are also supported. MDX is the preferred format because it allows for the inclusion of components and the ability to import and reuse other Markdown snippets.

### Custom Components

NUS Digital Twin's documentation utilises several custom components. The custom components can be found in the `src/components/docs` directory. The purpose of each custom component is described below.

#### `Head.astro`

A custom `Head` component is used to preload the fonts used in the documentation site. This approach is used instead of using the [`head` configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/configuration/#head) as imported fontsource URLs are not properly processed in the `head` configuration during production, leading to issues with preloading the fonts.

#### `SiteTitle.astro`

A custom `SiteTitle.astro` component is implemented to override the default site title, to allow a different title to be displayed for each set of documentation.

#### Add Custom Components

More custom components can be added via the Starlight configuration in `astro.config.mjs`. See [Overriding Components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) in Starlight's documentation for the steps.

### Markdown Snippets

Reusable markdown snippets are stored in `src/content/docs-partials` to share content between different documentation pages.

You can import and use these snippets within MDX files.

```mdx
---
title: Page Title
---

import About from '@content/docs-partials/about.mdx';

<About />
```
