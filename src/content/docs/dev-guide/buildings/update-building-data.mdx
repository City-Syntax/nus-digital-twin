import buildingData from '/src/content/buildings/buildings.json';

NUS Digital Twin provides detailed information for each campus building, including geographical data, fenestration details, and schedules. Currently, data is available for {buildingData.length} buildings.

The building data serves several purposes:

1. Displaying information to users upon building clicks
2. Powering the [Buildings API](/api-reference/endpoints/buildings)
3. Supporting the search bar functionality
4. Determining which OpenStreetMap buildings are shown

This guide covers how the information for each building can be updated.

## Update Building Data

The data for each building displayed on NUS Digital Twin is stored within a JSON file found at `src/content/buildings/buildings.json`. To add or update building information, simply edit this JSON file. Changes made here will be reflected in the application wherever building data is used.

The `building.json` file contains an array of objects. The complete schema for building data can be found in [Building Data Reference](../buildings-reference).

:::note
If there are multiple buildings with the same name, only the first occurrence is searchable, i.e. only the first occurrence will be displayed in the search bar.
:::

A sample of a `buildings.json` file is shown below, containing data for 4 buildings. As there are two occurrences of Cendana College, only the Cendana College with the `elementId` of `732229051` can be found in the search bar.
