NUS Digital Twin is built on [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/), which supports a variety of 3D models. There are several ways to add a custom building model into the application.

:::tip

Add the building data into `src/content/buildings/buildings.json` before adding a custom model to ensure picking works correctly. See [Update Building Data](../update-building-data) for instructions.

:::

## Using Cesium ion

Models uploaded to [Cesium ion](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-ion/) can be added into the platform. Use the [`Cesium3DTileset.fromIonAssetId`](https://cesium.com/learn/cesiumjs/ref-doc/Cesium3DTileset.html#.fromIonAssetId) method in Cesium to include a model hosted in Cesium ion.

<Steps>

1.  Upload the model to Cesium ion. Refer to the [Cesium ion 3D Tiling Documentation](https://cesium.com/learn/3d-tiling/ion-tile-3d-models/) for the steps to upload the model.

    :::tip

    Under 'What kind of data is this?' in Cesium ion, it is recommended to select '3D Model (tile as 3D Tiles)' to ensure the best performance.

    :::

2.  Add the code to retrieve the model from Cesium ion. A `featureIdLabel` which corresponds to the `elementId` in `src/content/buildings/buildings.json` should be included to allow building selection to function properly.

    ```ts
    // src/components/cesium/CesiumScene.astro
    const newModel = await Cesium3DTileset.fromIonAssetId(2686261, {
      show: false,
      featureIdLabel: <elementId>,
    });
    ```

3.  Add the `newModel` to the correct array to ensure it is attached to the correct group of models. This ensures that the model will be toggled on and off correctly.

    For example, when adding a building level rhino model, add the `newModel` to the `rhinoBuildingModels` array.

    ```diff lang="ts"
    const rhinoBuildingModels: Array<Model | Cesium3DTileset> = [
      ...
    +  newModel,
    ]
    ```

</Steps>

## Using Local or Remote Files

Model files stored locally within the repository or on remote storage such as AWS S3, Cloudflare R2 can also be loaded in the application, using the [`Model.fromGltfAsync`](https://cesium.com/learn/ion-sdk/ref-doc/Model.html#.fromGltfAsync) method in Cesium.

For model files stored within the repository, it is recommended to store them in the `public/` directory. See the [`public/` directory documentation](/dev-guide/design/project-structure/#the-public-directory) for more details.

<Steps>

1. Ensure the model is provided in `.glTF` format. Otherwise, convert the model file into a `.gltf` file. Refer to [the section below](#convert-from-other-file-types-to-gltf) for the conversion steps.

2. Add the code to retrieve the model from the repository and position it correctly on the map.

   ```ts
   // src/components/cesium/CesiumScene.astro
   const newModel = await Model.fromGltfAsync({
     modelMatrix: Transforms.headingPitchRollToFixedFrame(
       Cartesian3.fromDegrees(<longitude>, <latitude>, <height>),
       new HeadingPitchRoll(
         CesiumMath.toRadians(<heading in degrees>),
         CesiumMath.toRadians(<pitch in degrees>),
         CesiumMath.toRadians(<roll in degrees>)
       ),
     ),
     show: false,
     url: <url to gltf file>, // example: '/rvrc/rvrc-g-rhino.gltf'
     featureIdLabel: <element id>,
   });
   ```

3. Add the `newModel` to the correct array to ensure it is attached to the correct group of models. This ensures that the model will be toggled on and off correctly.

   For example, when adding a building level rhino model, add the `newModel` to the `rhinoBuildingModels` array.

   ```diff lang="ts"
   const rhinoBuildingModels: Array<Model | Cesium3DTileset> = [
     ...
   +  newModel,
   ]
   ```

</Steps>

## Convert from Other File Types to `.gltf`

To use local or remote model files, they have to be converted to `.gltf` format first.

### Wavefront Files (`.obj`, `.mtl`)

The recommend method is to use [`obj2gltf`](https://github.com/CesiumGS/obj2gltf).

```sh title="Example conversion"
obj2gltf -i model.obj
```

### COLLANDA Files (`.dae`)

The recommended method is to use [`COLLADA2GLTF`](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/COLLADA2GLTF).

```sh title="Example conversion"
./COLLADA2GTF-bin model.dae
```

### Rhino3D Files (`.3dm`)

The recommended method is to open the model in Rhino3D, and re-export it as a `.gltf` file.
