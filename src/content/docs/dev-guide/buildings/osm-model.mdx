NUS Digital Twin provides a urban-scale OpenStreetMap model, powered by [Cesium OSM Buildings](https://cesium.com/platform/cesium-ion/content/cesium-osm-buildings/).

## Add OpenStreetMap Building

The visibility of each building displayed for the OpenStreetMap urban-scale model can be controlled via the `src/content/buildings/buildings.json` file.

To add an OpenStreetMap building, add a `building` object with an `elementId` that matches the OSM `elementId` into the `buildings.json` file.

:::caution

This shares the same process as updating the building data. Updating the building data may have other side effects, such as adding an entry into the search results. See [Updating Building Data](/dev-guide/buildings/update-building-data) for complete details.

:::

```diff lang="json"
// src/content/buildings/buildings.json
[
  ...,
  {
    "elementId": "732229050",
    "name": "Yale-NUS College",
    "address": "20 College Ave East",
    "postal": "138529",
    "latitude": 1.30739,
    "longitude": 103.77257
-  }
+  }, {
+    "elementId": <OSM Element ID>,
+    "name": <building-name>,
+    "address": <address>,
+    "postal": <postal>,
+    "latitude": <latitude>,
+    "longitude": <longitude>
+  }
]
```

## Remove OpenStreetMap Building

To remove an OpenStreetMap building from display, find the matching `building` object in the `src/content/buildngs/buildings.json` file, and remove the entry.

:::caution

This shares the same process as updating the building data. Updating the building data may have other side effects, such as removing an entry from the search results. See [Updating Building Data](/dev-guide/buildings/update-building-data) for complete details.
