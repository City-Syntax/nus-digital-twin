NUS Digital Twin offers a set of tutorial videos to reinforce students' learning on the [tutorials page](/tutorials).

## Update Tutorial Videos

The tutorial videos are considered to be part of the documentation site, and is updated similarly to the documentation. The content for the tutorial videos is stored in `src/content/docs/tutorials`. To update the tutorial videos, edit the MDX/Markdown files within the directory.

A sample of a tutorial page is shown below. It is recommended for the `tableOfContents` and `lastUpdated` to be set to `false`, since they are not useful for the tutorial videos.

```mdx
// src/content/docs/tutorials/solar-simulation.mdx
