NUS Digital Twin offers many features to visualise information on buildings on campus. This article briefly introduces the features available.

## Basic Features

NUS Digital Twin provides many of the basic features available on other mapping applications:

- [Control (pan, zoom, rotate) the map](./basic-features/map-controls)
- [Toggle between the map layers](./basic-features/map-layers)
- [Reset to default view](./basic-features/map-controls/#reset-view)

## Building Data

On NUS Digital Twin, you can view information for each building on campus, including:

- General information, such as the address of each building
- Structural, enclosure and internal partitions
- Fenestration
- Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning
- Density and power
- Schedules

Our platform allows you to seamlessly switch between detailed building-level models and urban-scale models. The models available are listed below. Click on each item to find out more.

**Building-level models**

- [BIM models](./building-models/bim)
- Rhino models

**Urban-scale models**

- OpenStreetMap models
- Rhino models

## Points Of Interest

You can view data for some points of interest across the campus, some of which include images captured by thermal cameras. This feature is disabled by default, [learn how to turn it on]().

## Controls

You can find additional information about the buildings or campus in the controls section:

- [Energy](): View energy simulation results for each building. Information is only available for selected buildings.
- [Thermal Comfort]()
- [Wind]()
- [Solar]()
- [Distance]()

## Tutorial Videos

You can find bite-sized [tutorial videos](/tutorials) designed to help you reinforce your learning on building performance simulation concepts.
