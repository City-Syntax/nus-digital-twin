You can view data for points of interest across the campus, some of which include images captured by thermal cameras. This article guides you on how to view these points of interest.

## Enabling Points of Interest

A point of interest is marked by a <img src="/dot.png" style={{ display: 'inline-block', height: '1rem' }} /> on the map. If you do not see any on the map, you might have to enable them.
