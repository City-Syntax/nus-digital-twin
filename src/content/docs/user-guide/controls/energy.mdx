This article explains how to use the Energy controls available on the platform. 

The energy controls provide information on the energy use and energy use intensity of each building on campus, obtained from simulations run in ClimateStudio. An EnergyPlus `.idf` file is available for you to run your own simulations.

## Viewing Energy Use and Energy Use intensity

<Steps>
1. Select a building, using either the [search bar](/user-guide/building-data/#search-bar) or [directly selecting a building](/user-guide/building-data/#building-selection).
2. Click on the <span style={{ display: 'inline-block' }}><Icons.Energy height="1.125rem" width="1.125rem" /></span> button on the bottom right of the information panel, or from the menu on the right.
3. Toggle between Energy Use and Energy Use intensity from the dropdown in the Energy controls.
