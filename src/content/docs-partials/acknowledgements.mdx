NUS Digital Twin is built on the contributions of open-source communities and primarily developed using [CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs), [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [React](https://react.dev/). The platform's data is provided by our collaborators at City Syntax Lab, open-source data from OpenStreetMap, and our students from the National University of Singapore.
